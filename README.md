"In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of restaurant sales data using Microsoft Excel, focusing on uncovering meaningful patterns and trends to support strategic decision-making. I began by cleaning and organizing the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Leveraging the power of Pivot Tables, I segmented the data by various dimensions such as menu items, categories, order dates, and customer types to explore relationships and performance metrics across different areas of the business.

I used Pivot Charts to visually represent key insights, allowing for a clearer understanding of sales distribution and customer behavior. This included identifying the most and least popular items, peak and off-peak business hours, sales trends over time, and category-wise revenue contributions. Through slicers and filters, I made the dashboard interactive, enabling dynamic data exploration for stakeholders.

This analysis provided valuable insights such as optimizing the menu by focusing on high-performing items, adjusting staffing according to customer traffic trends, and tailoring marketing efforts to target slow-selling categories. The project demonstrated my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using Excelâ€™s analytical tools, reinforcing the importance of data-driven decision-making in the food service industry."
